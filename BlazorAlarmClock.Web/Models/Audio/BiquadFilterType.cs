	/// <summary>
	/// A lowpass filter allows frequencies below the cutoff frequency to pass through and attenuates frequencies above the cutoff.
	/// It implements a standard second-order resonant lowpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The cutoff frequency.<br />
	/// Q: Controls how peaked the response will be at the cutoff frequency. A large value makes the response more peaked.<br />
	/// Gain: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Lowpass,
	/// <summary>
	/// A highpass filter is the opposite of a lowpass filter. Frequencies above the cutoff frequency are passed through, but frequencies below the cutoff are attenuated.
	/// It implements a standard second-order resonant highpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The cutoff frequency below which the frequencies are attenuated.<br />
	/// Q: Controls how peaked the response will be at the cutoff frequency. A large value makes the response more peaked.<br />
	/// Gain: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Highpass,
	/// <summary>
	/// A bandpass filter allows a range of frequencies to pass through and attenuates the frequencies below and above this frequency range.
	/// It implements a second-order bandpass filter.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The center of the frequency band.<br />
	/// Q: Controls the width of the band. The width becomes narrower as the Q value increases.<br />
	/// Gain: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Bandpass,
	/// <summary>
	/// The lowshelf filter allows all frequencies through, but adds a boost (or attenuation) to the lower frequencies.
	/// It implements a second-order lowshelf filter.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The upper limit of the frequences where the boost (or attenuation) is applied.<br />
	/// Q: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// Gain: The boost, in dB, to be applied. If the value is negative, the frequencies are attenuated.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Lowshelf,
	/// <summary>
	/// The highshelf filter is the opposite of the lowshelf filter and allows all frequencies through, but adds a boost to the higher frequencies.
	/// It implements a second-order highshelf filter
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The lower limit of the frequences where the boost (or attenuation) is applied.<br />
	/// Q: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// Gain: The boost, in dB, to be applied. If the value is negative, the frequencies are attenuated.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Highshelf,
	/// <summary>
	/// The peaking filter allows all frequencies through, but adds a boost (or attenuation) to a range of frequencies.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The center frequency of where the boost is applied.<br />
	/// Q: Controls the width of the band of frequencies that are boosted. A large value implies a narrow width.<br />
	/// Gain: The boost, in dB, to be applied. If the value is negative, the frequencies are attenuated.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Peaking,
	/// <summary>
	/// The notch filter (also known as a band-stop or band-rejection filter) is the opposite of a bandpass filter.
	/// It allows all frequencies through, except for a set of frequencies.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The center frequency of where the notch is applied.<br />
	/// Q: Controls the width of the band of frequencies that are attenuated. A large value implies a narrow width.<br />
	/// Gain: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Notch,
	/// <summary>
	/// An allpass filter allows all frequencies through, but changes the phase relationship between the various frequencies.
	/// It implements a second-order allpass filter
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Frequency: The frequency where the center of the phase transition occurs. Viewed another way, this is the frequency with maximal group delay.<br />
	/// Q: Controls how sharp the phase transition is at the center frequency. A larger value implies a sharper transition and a larger group delay.<br />
	/// Gain: Not used in this filter type.<br />
	/// </remarks>
	Allpass,
